# Project Description
The goal of this project is to display the usage of Git, Docker, automated testing, and continuous integration and how they can improve the productivity and competitiveness of a company. Using these key components a company is able to advance their development operations (DevOps) which is a crucial in today's time because it enables faster development of new products and easier maintenance of existing deployments.

## Git: 
* Git is defined as a version control system that is used for tracking any changes in files in a coordinated fashion among developers. The key features within Git are allowance of feature branch workflow, distributed development, pull requests, and collaboration. All of these components lead to a faster release cycle which results in a better working environment for developers. These features help with the productivity and competitiveness of your company! 

## Docker: 
* Docker is defined as a tool that allows developers and organizations to easily create, deploy and run applications through the use of containers. Containers give the ability to package all requirements within a software application and deploy it as one package. This is advantageous to the developer/organization leveraging this technology because it ensures the application will work as intended. Utilizing the functionality of docker provide orgainzations the ability to deliver software quickly and accurately. 

## Continuous Integration: 
* Continuous integration is defined as the process where different developer's continously integrate their code to a centralized branch early on in the development process. By doing this they are able to avoid the pains of merging all their work at the same time, which may cause serious issues. A benefit of following this process is errors within the code can be identified and fixed quickly. “Continuous Integration doesn’t get rid of bugs, but it does make them dramatically easier to find and remove.” -Martin Fowler, Chief Scientist, ThoughtWorks. When an organization adopts this methodology within their development process it results in easier deployment of code and a faster development cycle. 

## Automated Testing: 
* Automated testing is defined as a software testing process that compares expected outcomes from an application with the actual outcome. The way a developer can achieve this is by writing test modules for the modules you have already developed. There are also applications that exist that will automatically test that your code passes all neccessary tests before it can be deployed. An example of such application is tox that is used to standardize testing in Python. Tox is utilzied to check that all your packages are installed correctly, integrates with continous integration servers like Jenkins, and runs all your tests within your environment. The benefits of using automated testing include a time saving, faster feedback, and allows for higher test coverage.
