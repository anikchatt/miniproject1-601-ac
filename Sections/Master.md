## Master Branch

The default branch name in Git is `master`. When first creating a new repository, git automatically assigns a `master` to the repository. As you start making commits, and every time you commit, the `master` branch pointer moves forward automatically. The master branch is the main branch where all changes from other working branching will be merged to at the end of any project.

It is important to note that there is nothing special about this branch in Git. It is exactly the same as any other branch in your repository. The `git init` command creates a `master` branch by default.

In some cases, the `master` branch is called the `main` branch. Git is beginning to use `main` and `master` interchangeably.
