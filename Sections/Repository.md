## Repository 
 
A repository within GitHub can be defined as a central location in which software applications are stored and managed. A repository will contain all the files and each of the changes made to the files for a given project. Repositories are useful because they allow you to manage your work and colloborate with others easily. Pull requests within a repository can allow for the proposal of changes to be be made. Issues can be submitted to track changes that need to be made to the code, gather user feedback, and report bugs within the software.  An example of how a repository is displayed on [Github](https://github.com/) can be seen below:
