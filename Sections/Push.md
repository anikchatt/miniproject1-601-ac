## Git-Push

`git push` updates the remote repository with any commits made locally to a branch. When working on a local cloned repository, and after making changes to the local repository, `git push` updates the branch that you are currently on but it is that same branch on the remote. Any new commits you have locally will be reflected on the remote repository so that others on your team can pull the changes to their respective local repositories.
