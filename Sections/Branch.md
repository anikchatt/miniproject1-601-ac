## Branch 

Branches in GitHub and Git allow for developers to work independently on their work without affecting other branches that are in the repository. The default branch when a repository is created is called main and a user can clone the repository to their local working station to create a development branch with the Git command `git checkout -b development`. Branches are typically used to develop features, fix bugs, and experiment with new coding methodly. When in the Git command line a user can run `git branch` to identify which branch they are working in. The Git command `git checkout new_branch` allows the user to switch to the branch titled 'new_branch' if it exists. An example of seeing the branches that have been created within a repository is shown below:
