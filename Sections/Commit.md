## Commit 

A commit is used to track the changes that were made in a project. It shows a snapshot of all the changes that occured and who made them. This is very important during software development because it provides transparency into what changed and why they changed. Using the Git command `git commit -m` the user is able to leave a comment about the changes that were made and why they made them. The image below depicts what details are shown from a commit within Github:
