## Clone 

`git clone` is utilized to create a local version of the [repository](/Sections/Repository.md). Creating a repository on GitHub means that it is a remote repository, so utilizing `git clone` on the Git command line will create a copy of the repository locally. The purpose of cloning is to allow developers to create a local version to work out of. A gif of how git cloning works can be seen below:
