## Merge  

After creating and working on a branch other than the master/main branch `git merge` can be used to merge lines of development together. In other words, we use the merge command to combine changes that are made on two or more distinct branches.   

It is important to note that **GitHub** keeps the entire branch development history on the merged branch.
